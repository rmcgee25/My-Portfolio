        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I consider myself as a person who is constantly asking why. I love finding out how things, people, and everything inbetween work.
            This curiosity has led my life personally and professionally. For the past 5 years I worked the social services industry from as a program manager
            and teacher. So why the career transition? Because in my 5 years of social work the one thing that remained consistent was the 
            advancement of tech. Although it was intended to be an advancement it often presented as a problem of accessibility within the communities I
            served. I canâ€™t help the communities I aim to serve without the knowledge that we need. To make change you have be the change. 
            Which started with me learning web development. Here lies my proof of change.
